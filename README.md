# I've arrived
**I've arrived** is a new solution, tailored for various small to medium businesses, providing a complete solution for delivering different kind of packages.


## Inspiration
The COVID-19 virus put many small and medium businesses into a difficult situation as customers are not going to shops. These entrepreneurs or companies were not prepared for home delivery.
Current solutions end up being inefficient with the delivery being uncertain. Long waiting times are also a risk for spreading the virus .
Another part we focus on is providing a plugin for existing package delivery solutions as it helps to minimize the waiting time for courriers as the app notifies the user in real-time when the delivery is close and provides a virtual ringing, so delivery efficiency can be increased by ~20%.

## What it does
We are designing and  developing a Software as a Service type of solution where SMEs can generate and register their shop/service and start their own package delivery service supported by our modern applications. Users can find every registered SME in our application. This way, local shops can use one easy platform to manage delivery. Customers can easily check local SMEs that offer delivery and this way local businesses can generate extra revenue. The solution also offers real-time and easy package monitoring by default and people can know exactly when their package will arrive.
Delivery shares will be also part of the solution so drivers can help each other optimize routes and handle multiple packages.
We think that this service is a great option for SMEs to quickly jump into delivery service and keep their business going.
Also, this solution can be a plugin for existing package delivery services into existing sites or applications as well. It helps drivers and customers to minimize waiting time with modern proximity and real-time monitoring and with a virtual ring feature.

## How We built it
Our solution has two web-based frontends and two mobile applications.
- Admin web frontend: this is where a business can register and customize some basic things (logo, colors, background, etc.), also on this site the application can be managed and overviewed.
- Driver mobile application: an independent application for local businesses or a plugin to existing package delivery companies. It is used to notify users about delivery and proximity of the package to ensure that the user will be outside waiting for the package to minimize the waiting time.
- User mobile application: a more advanced application where packages can be monitored from every shop from where they have ordered including the local small businesses
